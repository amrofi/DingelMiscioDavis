Census population counts (series B and C) can be found by navigating to
Census Digital Library.
From there, navigate to "Tables" to access data for Census years (2001, 2011).
The result should be the active server page:

FAQ:

Why do we use "city" files?

While population counts are available at the sub-district level,
socioeconomic characteristics like educational composition are not.
Thus, we are forced to use "urban agglomerations" for these exercises.
Comparison of
"B-9- Delhi.xls" ("district") and
"B-9 City -  Delhi.xls" ("city") files:
Delhi has nine districts.
The Delhi urban agglomeration ("DMC(U) (M Corp.)")
has components in all nine districts.
At the same time, there are nine other urban agglomeration
that are defined in this state.
In the "district" file, you only see educational composition by district,
while for the "city" file you see UAs' characteristics.
Thus, our exercise about the distribution of skills in India is
obviously hampered by this limitation.
